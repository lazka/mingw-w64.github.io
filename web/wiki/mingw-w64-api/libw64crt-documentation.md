# libw64crt Documentation

## The ironCrate Documenation

The first goal of this library is to provide an alternative C-runtime
for x86/x64 Windows operating systems. It shall be compatible to the
msvcrt variants. The second goal is that this library provides a
build-variant for kernel-mode, too. Additionally it shall provide some
optional features well known from the POSIX world. This library is at
the moment under construction. We still search for an final name for it.
Current suggestions are "ironCrate", and "wormcrt". If you have better
suggestions, feel free to contact our developer team.

The version of this library is at the moment 0.0, as this library is in
pre-alpha phase. We are at the moment in planning and drafting phase.
Before we will change version to 0.1 at least some basics have to be
present (build-environment, startup-code, partial function set for
threading).
