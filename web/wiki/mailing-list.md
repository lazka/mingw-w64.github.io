## mingw-w64-documentation

This list is created for submitting documentation related to Microsoft
Windows development headers and libraries. Subscription to the list is
moderated in order to control what materials are posted, but it should
be open for public viewing.

The list accepts documentations such as natural language description of
data structures and functions, and values for constants. Copying and
posting material directly from headers and libraries under Microsoft
EULA is strictly prohibited.

The headers and libraries released by Microsoft is under copyright, so
it may not be redistributed or copied without permission from Microsoft.
It is however not under Non-Disclosure Agreement, hence descriptions and
documentations are allowed. The posted documentation allows any
developer to recreate the headers and libraries without infringing on
copyright. [Archive
